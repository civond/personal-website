                        My interest in signal processing began during my previous research experience where I focused on quantification of olfactory behavior in mice
                        with the use of deep-learning tools such as DeepLabCut and data visualization using Python. It was in this period where I realized that so much useful 
                        information can be extracted out of signals.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Thus, upon beginning my Master's program in biomedical engineering at New York University, I decided to dedicate myself to this subspecialty. 
                        Specifically, my interest is in biosignal processing. So far, I have gained significant experience with filter design and subsequent hardware implementations. 
                        This is showcased by the realtime ECG monitoring device that I designed with a group during this semester, where I acted as the software lead for signal acquisition and processing.
                        To complement this, my current research project in the Computation Medicine Laboratory involves wearable device design.

                        If I could describe myself in one sentence, it would be: "Naturally curious and always looking for ways to improve myself and help those around me."!!
